# Scripts

These are scripts built to help solve and automate different tasks from various IT roles. Depending on the script there may be some dependencies needed, such as ActiveDirectory module, VMware PowerCLI, or the Netmiko package.

## Uses
Here are some of the tasks I've used these scripts for:
* Router / switch config change monitoring
* VMware guest OS disk usage for SQL SSRS reporting
* PRTG custom sensors
* Active Directory temporary OU access
* Active Directory user reset and unlocking
* Cisco Unity Connection voicemail emailing
* Zerto alerts and RPO reporting
* Bitlocker key collection
